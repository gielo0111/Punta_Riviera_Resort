		<h1> About Us</h1>
		Punta Riviera Del Mar Resort is an upmarket, romantic family resort located 
		in the heart of Luzon Island to the North of Manila facing westwards towards
		the South China Sea. It is reached by road. For overseas guests visiting 
		Philippines for the first time we recommend car + driver hire from one of the
		reputable firms at Manila or Clark Airports (see Transport) or by bus. We also
		recommend a review of our Travel Guide (Practical Tips for Surviving the Philippines)
		that deals with important issues like local customs, safety, security and financial matters
		<br><br>
		
		Where the River Ilog Malino meets the sea on this stunning coastline each morning
		brings a touch of magic to our doorstep here at Punta Riviera Resort,Brgy,Ilog Malino,
		Bolinao, Pangasinan, Luzon,Philippines. Join us and share a peaceful and meaningful
		holiday in harmony with nature.  Shed your frustrations and city stresses as cool sea breezes
		immerses your body in fresh air and lift your spirits, whilst sand and seawater runs between your toes.
		
		<br><br>
		
		Morning rush-hour traffic as viewed from your balcony is guaranteed to be both light and
		tolerable. Back to nature - paddle one of our kayaks for
		several kilometers up the mangrove fringed Amazonian-like Ilog Malino lagoon - but  watch out for iguanas!   
		
		<br><br>
		Uniquely located at the estuary of the IlogMalino river the view from our elevated sea
		frontage embraces a stunning marine ecology with constant, natural air conditioning from
		incoming cool sea breezes as frothy turquoise waves crash onto the edge of the coral fringe only 100m away.
		To our right a deep mangrove fringed river can be seen where frogs, crabs and iguanas thrive and bangus are harvested.   
		<br><br>
		Such natural environments are forever changing as tides come and go, the river rises,
		falls and twists and shade from our coconut trees (boco) create a moving visual feast
		of textured patterns on our lawns.
		No wonder why so many Filipina girls chose to have their beach wedding at Punta!    
		<br><br>
		
		In 2011 our new Don Quixote bar (above, below ) was opened by the riverside next to our new Spa
		facilities offering indoor pursuits such as pool, darts, karaoke, table tennis in addition to a range
		of board games,WiFi facilities, cable TV, and video and book libraries. Outdoor pastimes and games include
		volleyball, kayaking, beach games, swimming, snorkeling, fishing, beach combing, walking and jogging.
		A range of Team Building, artistic and cultural pursuits, aerobics and live bands can be arranged for groups
		with advance notice. Bonfires,
		fireworks and beach BBQ facilities are also available under the stars on our canderoma fringed island.    
		<br><br>
